# AaveOFTBridge

The AaveOFTBridge is a contract to facilitate moving USDT between networks using USDT0 OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) via LayerZero V2. This provides seamless, 1:1 cross-chain USDT transfers with no slippage.

## How USDT0 Works

USDT0 is Tether's official cross-chain solution using LayerZero's OFT standard. It enables unified USDT liquidity across chains without wrapped tokens.

### Architecture

- **On Ethereum**: Uses `OAdapterUpgradeable` which locks native USDT and sends LayerZero message
- **On Other Chains**: Uses `OUpgradeable` which mints/burns USDT0

### Key Benefits

- **No Slippage**: 1:1 lock/mint mechanism (unlike liquidity pool bridges)
- **Unified Liquidity**: All USDT0 is backed 1:1 by USDT on Ethereum
- **Dual DVN Security**: Verified by both LayerZero DVN and USDT0 DVN

## Functions

### `bridge()`

Bridges USDT to a destination chain. The steward pulls USDT from the Aave Collector via `ICollector.transfer()`, so it must have the Collector `FUNDS_ADMIN` role. The quoted LayerZero messaging fee should be supplied as native token value with the `bridge()` call.

### `quoteBridge()`

Returns the native token fee required for bridging. Call this before `bridge()` to know how much native token value to send with the transaction.

### `quoteOFT()`

Returns the expected amount to be received on the destination chain. Use this value as `minAmountLD` in the `bridge()` call.

For USDT0 OFT transfers, this should return the same amount (1:1, no slippage).

## Usage Pattern

```solidity
// 1. Quote the expected received amount
uint256 expectedReceived = bridge.quoteOFT(dstEid, amount, receiver);

// 2. Quote the native fee
uint256 fee = bridge.quoteBridge(dstEid, amount, receiver, expectedReceived);

// 3. Grant the steward the Collector FUNDS_ADMIN role
IAccessControl(address(collector)).grantRole(
    ICollector(address(collector)).FUNDS_ADMIN_ROLE(),
    address(bridge)
);

// 4. Execute the bridge, sending the quoted native fee
bridge.bridge{value: fee}(dstEid, amount, receiver, expectedReceived, fee);
```

## Permissions

The contract implements `OwnableWithGuardian` for permissioned functions. The owner should be the respective network's Level 1 Executor (Governance), and the guardian should be a trusted operations role.

The steward must also be granted the Collector `FUNDS_ADMIN` role so it can call `ICollector.transfer()`.

The owner or guardian can:

- Call `bridge()` to initiate transfers
- Call rescue functions to return assets to the Collector

Only the owner can:

- Update allowed receivers
- Transfer ownership

## Security Considerations

- The contract inherits from `RescuableBase`, exposing rescue hooks used by the steward's rescue functions
- Slippage protection via `minAmountLD` parameter prevents receiving less than expected
- The `quoteOFT()` function should be called immediately before bridging to get accurate amounts
- Only the owner or guardian can execute bridges, and only to explicitly allowed receivers

## Retry Mechanism

LayerZero includes a retry mechanism to handle transactions which fail to execute on the destination chain.

Because LayerZero separates the verification of a message from its execution, if a message fails to execute, it can be retried without having to resend it from the origin chain. This is possible because the message has already been confirmed by the DVNs as a valid message packet, meaning execution can be retried at any time, by anyone.

### How to Retry

To retry a failed message:

1. **LayerZero Scan Interface**: Use the [LayerZero Scan](https://layerzeroscan.com/) UI to locate and retry the failed message
2. **Direct Contract Call**: Call the `lzReceive` function directly on the Endpoint contract

For more details, see the [LayerZero debugging documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/troubleshooting/debugging-messages#retry-message).

### Not Supported

| Chain     | Reason              |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Avalanche | No USDT0 deployment |
| Base      | No USDT0 deployment |

## Known Limitations

1. **USDT0 Only**: Only transfers within the USDT0 system are supported.

2. **LayerZero Fees**: A small native token fee is required for the LayerZero messaging. Use `quoteBridge()` to get the exact fee.
